Apple___Apple_scab,सेब का पपड़ी रोग ,"Leaf Lesions: The most common and recognizable symptom is the appearance of dark, olive-green to black lesions on the leaves. These lesions are often irregularly shaped and have a velvety or scaly texture. As the disease progresses, the lesions may coalesce, leading to extensive damage to the leaf surface.  Fruit Lesions: Scab also affects apple fruit. Infected fruit develop small, circular or irregularly shaped lesions with a rough, scabby appearance. The color of the lesions varies from olive-green to dark brown or black. As the fruit matures, the scabby lesions may become more prominent and affect the overall appearance of the fruit.  Twig Lesions: While less common, apple scab can also cause small, elongated lesions on young twigs. These lesions may not be as obvious as those on the leaves and fruit, but they can contribute to the spread of the disease.  Leaf Deformation: Severe infections of apple scab on leaves can lead to distortion and curling of the foliage, affecting the tree's overall health and vigor.  Premature Leaf Drop: The disease can cause infected leaves to drop prematurely from the tree, reducing the photosynthetic capacity and potentially weakening the tree over time.","Apple scab is typically spread through airborne spores produced by the fungus. The primary sources of infection are fallen leaves and infected fruit left on the ground from the previous growing season. In spring, when the conditions are favorable for the fungus to grow, the spores are released and can infect new leaves and fruit.","While it's challenging to completely cure apple scab once a tree is infected, it can be managed and controlled with a combination of cultural practices and fungicide applications. Here are some strategies to control apple scab:  Sanitation: Rake up and remove fallen leaves and fruit from around the apple tree. This helps reduce the primary source of infection for the following year. Pruning: Properly prune the apple tree to improve air circulation within the canopy, which reduces the humidity and dampness that favor disease development. Resistant varieties: Plant apple tree varieties that are less susceptible to scab infection. Consult with local horticulturists or agricultural extension offices for suitable varieties in your region. Fungicides: In commercial orchards or severe cases, applying fungicides can be an effective way to control scab. Fungicides need to be applied preventatively, starting in early spring when the buds begin to swell and continuing at regular intervals during wet and humid periods. Organic alternatives: Some organic fungicides, such as neem oil and copper-based sprays, can be used to manage apple scab. They may require more frequent applications than synthetic fungicides."
Apple___Black_rot, सेब का काला सड़न,"The symptoms of apple black rot can vary depending on the affected plant parts and the stage of the disease. Common symptoms include:  Fruit Lesions: Infected apples develop circular or elongated lesions with distinct margins. Initially, the lesions are brown or black, and as the disease progresses, they become sunken and may have concentric rings, giving the fruit a ""frog-eye"" appearance.  Shoot Blight: Young shoots and small branches may exhibit cankers, which are sunken, dark areas on the bark. These cankers can lead to dieback of the affected shoots.  Leaf Symptoms: In some cases, black rot can cause dark, irregularly shaped lesions on the leaves, often accompanied by yellowing and premature leaf drop.  Mummified Fruit: Infected fruit may become mummified, becoming shriveled and dry on the tree or remaining attached throughout the winter.","The black rot fungus survives in infected plant debris, such as dead leaves and fruit left on the ground or remaining on the tree. In spring, the fungus produces spores that are spread by rain, wind, or insects to new plant tissue, infecting young shoots, fruit, and branches. Warm and wet conditions during the growing season favor the development and spread of the disease.","Apple black rot can be challenging to cure once established, but several management practices can help prevent and control the disease:  Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris, including fallen leaves and mummified fruit. This reduces the primary source of inoculum for the next growing season.  Pruning: Prune and remove infected branches and shoots during dormancy to limit the spread of the disease within the tree.  Fungicides: Apply fungicides preventatively during the growing season to protect susceptible plant tissues from infection. Copper-based fungicides and other fungicides labeled for apple black rot can be effective if applied according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Apple___Cedar_apple_rust, देवदार सेब जंग,"On Apple and Crabapple Trees:  Yellow Spots: In the early stages, small, bright yellow spots appear on the upper surface of the leaves. Orange Spore Pustules: As the disease progresses, these yellow spots develop into raised, orange or rust-colored spore-filled pustules on the undersides of the leaves. Leaf Curling: Infected leaves may curl, distort, or become dwarfed due to the presence of the pustules. On Eastern Red Cedar or Juniper Hosts:  Gall Formation: The fungus forms small, brown, woody galls on the branches of the Eastern red cedar or Juniper. These galls have a distinctive appearance and are often referred to as ""cedar apples"" or ""cedar galls."" Spore Production: During wet conditions, the galls release orange, gelatinous spore horns from the galls, which are then carried by the wind to infect apple trees.","The Cedar Apple Rust fungus produces spores on the Eastern red cedar or Juniper host during the spring, which are then carried by wind to infect apple or crabapple trees. The disease cycle continues as the fungus produces spores on the apple trees, which are carried back to the juniper host. The disease thrives in regions where both apple trees and Eastern red cedars or Junipers coexist.","Controlling Cedar Apple Rust involves several strategies to break the disease cycle and reduce its impact:  Sanitation: Remove and destroy any cedar galls from infected Juniper hosts during the winter or early spring before they release spores. This helps reduce spore production and subsequent infections on apple trees.  Planting Distance: If possible, avoid planting apple trees near Eastern red cedar or Juniper hosts to reduce the chances of disease spread.

Orange___Haunglongbing_(Citrus_greening),सिट्रस ग्रीनिंग रोग,"HLB symptoms can vary depending on the citrus tree's age, the severity of the infection, and the citrus variety. Common symptoms include:  Yellowing: Yellowing of the leaves, called ""chlorosis,"" is one of the earliest and most distinctive symptoms of HLB. The yellowing typically starts in a mottled pattern, affecting random areas of the canopy.  Asymmetrical Leaf Blotching: HLB-infected leaves often exhibit asymmetrical blotches of yellowing and green on the same leaf, a pattern known as ""blotchy mottle.""  Vein Yellowing: The veins of the leaves may remain green while the surrounding tissue turns yellow, creating a ""green island"" effect.  Twisted Growth and Small Fruits: Affected branches may exhibit stunted, twisted, or ""witches' broom"" growth. The fruits on HLB-infected trees are often small, lopsided, and poorly colored. ","HLB is primarily transmitted by a tiny insect called the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri). When the psyllid feeds on an infected citrus tree, it can acquire the bacterium and then transmit it to healthy citrus trees as it feeds on them. Once inside a healthy tree, the bacterium spreads and colonizes the tree's phloem vessels, disrupting the flow of nutrients, water, and sugars throughout the plant. This eventually leads to the decline of the tree and the development of various symptoms.","As of now, there is no cure for Citrus Greening, and infected trees will eventually die. Management of the disease focuses on early detection, removal of infected trees, and control of the Asian citrus psyllid population to limit the spread of the disease. Here are some key management strategies:  Early Detection and Removal: Regularly inspect citrus trees for symptoms of HLB. If a tree is confirmed to be infected, it should be removed and properly disposed of to prevent further spread of the disease.  Use of Healthy Plant Material: When planting new citrus trees, use certified disease-free nursery stock to reduce the risk of introducing HLB.  Insect Control: Implement a comprehensive insect control program to manage the Asian citrus psyllid population. This may involve the use of insecticides, beneficial insects, and cultural practices to reduce psyllid infestations.  Quarantine Measures: In regions where HLB is present, implement strict quarantine measures to prevent the movement of infected plant material.  Research and Breeding: Researchers are actively working on developing HLB-resistant citrus varieties through breeding and genetic modification."

Not all, but a few of the infected tubers give rise to primary sporangial inoculum which further infects the nearby plants creating a primary focus of infection in the field.  Some of the infected tubers do not sprout or are soon killed after sprouting giving patchy appearance in the field.","   Choose resistant potato varieties: Select potato types that have natural resistance to late blight. These varieties are less likely to get infected and can withstand the disease better.  Rotate crops: Avoid planting potatoes in the same area year after year. Instead, grow non-potato crops in between to disrupt the disease cycle and reduce the number of pathogens in the soil.  Clean up plant debris: Remove and destroy any infected plant parts like leaves, stems, and tubers at the end of the season. This helps eliminate disease-causing spores and prevents them from surviving and spreading.  Use fungicides: Consider applying fungicides to protect your potato plants. These chemicals can help prevent late blight infection. Follow the instructions on the product label to ensure safe and effective use.  By following these measures, you can minimize the risk of late blight and protect your potato crops from this destructive disease."

Squash___Powdery_mildew,स्क्वैश(कद्दू) का  पाउडर रूपी फफूंद,"Powdery white or grayish fungal growth on the leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits of squash plants. Initially, the powdery mildew appears as small spots or patches, which gradually spread and cover larger areas. Infected leaves may become distorted, turn yellow or brown, and eventually die. Severe infections can lead to stunted growth and reduced fruit production.","Squash powdery mildew is primarily caused by a fungal pathogen called Podosphaera xanthii. This pathogen belongs to a group of fungi known as powdery mildews. It specifically affects various squash plants, including zucchini, pumpkin, and butternut squash.  The fungus thrives in warm and dry conditions, with optimal growth occurring between 60°F and 80°F (15°C to 27°C). It spreads through airborne spores that are easily carried by wind, water, and insects. When these spores land on susceptible plant surfaces, they germinate and form a white or grayish powdery growth.","Plant resistant varieties: Choose squash varieties that are known to have resistance to powdery mildew. These varieties are less susceptible to the disease and can withstand infections better.  Proper spacing: Provide adequate spacing between squash plants to improve air circulation. Good airflow helps reduce humidity and prevents the development and spread of powdery mildew.  Watering techniques: Avoid overhead watering, which can promote the growth and spread of fungal spores. Instead, water at the base of the plants using drip irrigation or a soaker hose. Watering in the early morning allows foliage to dry quickly, reducing moisture levels.  Regular inspections: Monitor your squash plants regularly for any signs of powdery mildew. Early detection can help prevent the spread of the disease to other plants. If you notice any infected leaves, remove them immediately and dispose of them properly.  Fungicide applications: In severe cases or when prevention methods are not sufficient, you can consider using fungicides labeled for powdery mildew control. Follow the instructions and guidelines provided by the manufacturer for proper application and timing. Remember to consider the pre-harvest interval (PHI) before using any chemical treatments."
Strawberry___Leaf_scorch,झरबेर या हिसालु(स्ट्रॉबेरी) पत्ती झुलसना,"Leaf scorch makes strawberry leaves look like they’ve been burnt by something.  Beginning signs of leaf scorch include:  Irregular dark purple or brown spots scattered over leaf surface Appearance of “tar drops” on leaves Spots with purple centers and no defined border (the leaf spot disease has a clear margin) As the disease progresses, the symptoms intensify and look more unsightly:  Large sunken lesions where spots have merged together Purplish to brown colored areas that can girdle leaves from the base Brown, curled up leaves Scorched dying leaves Weakened vigor Dead leaves, flowers, or fruit (in severe infections)","Fungal infection: Strawberry leaf scorch is caused by a fungus called Diplocarpon earliana. It infects strawberry plants, especially in humid and rainy conditions.  Humidity and moisture: High humidity and wet leaves create a favorable environment for the fungus to grow and spread. Rainy weather or overwatering can contribute to leaf scorch.  Infected plant material: The fungus can survive on fallen leaves or infected runners. If you leave these materials around, the disease can continue to spread to healthy plants.  Susceptible varieties: Some strawberry varieties are more prone to leaf scorch. If you're experiencing frequent outbreaks, consider choosing resistant varieties in the future.  Environmental stress: Weak or stressed plants are more vulnerable to diseases. Factors like drought, heat stress, or poor soil conditions can make plants more susceptible to leaf scorch.","While leaf scorch on strawberry plants can be frustrating, there are some strategies which home gardeners may employ to help prevent its spread in the garden. The primary means of strawberry leaf scorch control should always be prevention.                                                                                                                                      Since this fungal pathogen overwinters on the fallen leaves of infected plants, proper garden sanitation is key. This includes the removal of infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants. The creation of new plantings and strawberry patches is key to maintaining a consistent strawberry harvest, as older plants are more likely to show signs of severe infection.  When making new plantings always ensure that good planting practices are implemented. These practices include the use of proper plant spacing to provide adequate air circulation and the use of drip irrigation. The avoidance of waterlogged soil and frequent garden cleanup will help to reduce the likelihood of spread of this fungus.  "

Tomato___Bacterial_spot,टमाटर में जीवाण्विक धब्बे,"Symptoms can be seen on the foliage, stems, and fruits of tomatoes. Initially small yellow-green lesions appear on young leaves for bacterial spot, whilst bacterial speck causes black spots with a narrow yellow halo.                                                                                                                                                                                           They are usually more numerous on leaf margins or tips, which may appear deformed and twisted. In severe cases, the spots of bacterial speck may coalesce or overlap, resulting in larger and irregular lesions. Bacterial spot lesions can enlarge from 0.25 cm to 0.5 cm and become tan to brownish-red, which will eventually look like shot holes when the center dries up. Bacterial spot produces similar lesion of fruits as it does on the leaves and eventually roughen, becoming brown and scabbed. Bacterial speck causes tiny, slightly raised black specks. It is difficult to distinguish between these two diseases at an early stage.","Bacterial spot of tomato is caused by Xanthomonas vesicatoria, Xanthomonas euvesicatoria, Xanthomonas gardneri, and Xanthomonas perforans.  These bacterial pathogens can be introduced into a garden on contaminated seed and transplants, which may or may not show symptoms.  The pathogens enter plants through natural openings (e.g., stomates), as well as through wounds.  Disease development is favored by warm (75° to 86°F), wet weather.  Wind-driven rain can contribute to more severe disease as the pathogens are splashed and spread to healthy leaves and fruit.  Bacterial spot pathogens can survive well in tomato debris, but they survive very poorly in soil when not associated with debris.","Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants to prevent the introduction of bacterial spot pathogens on contaminated seed or seedlings.  If a clean seed source is not available or you suspect that your seed is contaminated, soak seeds in water at 122°F for 25 min. to kill the pathogens.                                                                      To keep leaves dry and to prevent the spread of the pathogens, avoid overhead watering (e.g., with a wand or sprinkler) of established plants and instead use a drip-tape or soaker-hose.  Also to prevent spread, DO NOT handle plants when they are wet (e.g., from dew) and routinely sterilize tools with either 10% bleach solution or (better) 70% alcohol (e.g., rubbing alcohol).  Where bacterial spot has been a recurring problem, consider using preventative applications of copper-based products registered for use on tomato, especially during warm, wet periods.                                                                                        Keep in mind however, that if used excessively or for prolonged periods, copper may no longer control the disease.  Be sure to read and follow all label instructions of the product that you select to ensure that you use it in the safest and most effective manner possible.  Burn, bury or hot compost tomato debris at the end of the season.  Wait at least one year before planting tomatoes in a given location again, and remove and burn, bury or hot compost any volunteer tomatoes that come up in your garden."

Tomato___Late_blight,टमाटर में देरी से होने वाली अंगमारी,"Brownish-green spots appear on the leaf margins and leaf tops. Later, large areas of the leaves turn brown completely. During wet weather, lesions on the lower side of the leaves may be covered with a gray to white moldy growth, making it easier to distinguish healthy from dead leaf tissue. As the disease progresses, the foliage runs brown, curls and dries. In some cases, the sharply delimited brown spots and the white covering also appear on the stems, branches, and petioles. Greyish-green to dirty-brown and wrinkled stains appear on the fruits. At these spots, the fruit flesh is hardened",The risk of infection is highest in midsummer. The fungus enters the plant via wounds and rips in the skin. Temperature and moisture are the most important environmental factors affecting the development of the disease. Late blight fungi grow best in high relative humidities (around 90%) and in temperature ranges of 18 to 26°C.

Tomato___Leaf_Mold,टमाटर की पर्ण फफूँदी,"Symptoms commonly occur on both sides of the foliage and sometimes on fruit. Older leaves are infected first and then the disease slowly moves up towards young leaves. On the upper leaf surface, small, diffuse, pale green or yellowish spots with indefinite margins appear. On the underside, olive green to grayish purple and velvety patches develop below the leaf spots. These are composed of spore-producing structures and spore masses (conidia). Over time, as the spots enlarge, the color of the infected leaf changes from yellowish (chlorosis) to brown (necrosis) and the leaf begins to curl and dry. The leaves will drop prematurely, leading to defoliation in severe cases. Occasionally, this pathogen causes disease on the blossoms or fruits with various symptoms. The blossoms may turn black and will be killed before fruit set. Green and ripe fruits will develop smooth black irregular area on the stem end. As the disease progresses, the infected area becomes sunken, dry and leathery.","The symptoms are caused by the fungus Mycovellosiella fulva, whose spores can survive without a host for 6 months to a year at room temperature (non-obligate). Prolonged leaf moisture and humidities above 85% favor the germination of spores. The temperature must be between 4° to 34 °C for spores to germinate, with an optimum temperature at 24-26°C. Dry conditions and the absence of free water on leaves impair germination. The symptoms usually start to appear 10 days after inoculation with the development of spots on both sides of the leaf blade. On the underside, a large number of spore-producing structures are formed and these spores are easily spread from plant to plant by the wind and water splashing, but also on tools, clothing of workers and insects. The pathogen usually infects the leaves by penetrating through stomata in a high humidity level."," Use certified, disease-free seeds, plant resistant or resilient varieties if available in your area.

Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot,टमाटर का सेप्टोरिया पत्तों पर धब्बा,"Septoria leaf spots start off somewhat circular and first appear on the undersides of older leaves, at the bottom of the plant. They are small, 1/16 to 1/8 inches (1.6 to 3.2 millimeters) in diameter, with a dark brown margin and lighter gray or tan centers. A yellow halo may surround the spot.  As the disease develops, the spots will get larger and may merge. If you view them through a magnifying lens you may see the fruiting bodies of the fungus, which look like dark brown pimples. This is one of the symptoms that distinguish Septoria leaf spot from other leaf-spotting diseases.​  Although the symptoms usually occur in the older, lower leaves, the disease can develop at any stage in the tomato plant's life.1 They may also appear on the stems as well as the blossoms and calyxes. One small bit of good news—they rarely affect the fruits.  If untreated, Septoria leaf spot will cause the leaves to turn yellow and eventually dry out and fall off. This will weaken the plant, send it into decline, and cause sun scalding of the unprotected, exposed tomatoes. Without leaves, the plant will not continue producing and maturing tomatoes. Septoria leaf spot spreads rapidly.","Fungal infection: Tomato septoria leaf spot is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici. It commonly affects tomato plants, particularly in warm and humid conditions.  Spread: The fungus spreads through water splashes, rain, or irrigation. It can also be carried on tools, equipment, or hands, which come into contact with infected plants.  Infected plant debris: The fungus can overwinter on infected plant debris, such as fallen leaves or stems. If these materials are not removed and properly disposed of, the disease can persist and spread to healthy plants in subsequent seasons.","First, remove all fallen plant debris from your garden beds. Fallen leaves can harbor spores and allow them to overwinter. Be sure to clean your hands and sterilize tools you use to remove debris if you suspect fungal disease may be present.  Keep weeds in check. This is especially true with septoria lycopersici. Many solanaceous weeds can harbor fungal spores. Diseased weeds will spread the disease to nearby plants.  Mulch around your plants. This has a dual effect. It prevents soil splashing up onto the leaves, which can spread spores to your plant. It also reduces the likelihood of weed development. A 3″ to 4″ layer of mulch will also aid in water retention in the soil, which is an added bonus!  Water the soil, not the plants. Drip or soaker hose irrigation will reduce the likelihood of spore spread.  Rotate crops. Septoria fungi can survive in diseased plant debris, weeds, or perennials for up to 3 years. Crop rotation can reduce the likelihood of reinfection year after year.  Ensure there’s proper airflow. Plants which are tightly packed together are more at risk from diseases. Trimming excess foliage will provide better airflow. It also reduces the ease of spore spread, as leaves are spaced further apart. Staking plants or securing them in sturdy tomato cages can help with airflow as well.  Keep pests at bay. Remember, pests may accidentally carry spores from plant to plant. Reducing your pest population will also reduce spore transmission."

In older plants, the infection results in excessive branching, thicker and wrinkled leaves, and interveinal chlorosis clearly visible on the leaf blade. At later stages of the disease, the plants take a leathery texture and their chlorotic margins are rolled upwards and inwards. If the infection takes place before the flowering stage, the number of fruits is considerably reduced, even though there are no noticeable symptoms on their surface.",TYLCV is not seed-borne and is not transmitted mechanically. It is spread by whiteflies of the Bemisia tabaci species. These whiteflies feed on the lower leaf surface of a number of plants and are attracted by young tender plants. The whole infection cycle can take place in about 24 hours and is favored by dry weather with high temperatures.,"Use resistant or tolerant varieties. Plant early to avoid peak populations of the whitefly.  Intercrop with rows of non-susceptible plants such as squash and cucumber.  Use nets to cover seedbeds and prevent whiteflies from  reaching plants.  Practice crop rotation with non-susceptible plants.  Mulch the seedbed or the field to break the life cycle of the whitefly.  Use sticky yellow plastic traps to mass-catch the insect.  Monitor the field, handpick diseased plants and bury them away from the field.  Find and eradicate weeds in and around the field.

Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus,टमाटर मोज़ेक वायरस,"Early infection may cause plants to look yellow and generally stunted. Dark and light green leaves mottling. There may be twisted, deformed, or diminished leaves. At warm temperatures, certain cultivars may show signs of dead leaf tissue. Possible uneven ripening of fruits. Decreased total fruit yield and average fruit size. Fruit with irregular, off-color spots that can be either elevated or depressed. Fruits may exhibit browning just beneath the skin (brownwall).","Viral infection: Tomato mosaic virus (TMV) is caused by a virus that infects tomato plants. It can also affect other plants in the Solanaceae family, such as peppers and eggplants.  Transmission: The virus spreads through direct contact with infected plants, contaminated tools, or hands. It can also be carried by insects, such as aphids and whiteflies, which feed on infected plants and then transfer the virus to healthy ones.  Contaminated seeds: TMV can be present in infected tomato seeds, leading to the transmission of the virus to new plants during germination and growth.","Use virus-free seeds: Purchase certified disease-free tomato seeds from reputable suppliers to minimize the risk of introducing the virus into your crops.  Practice strict hygiene: Clean and sanitize tools, equipment, and hands before handling tomato plants. This helps prevent the spread of the virus between plants.  Control insect vectors: Implement measures to control aphids, whiteflies, and other insects that can transmit the virus. This may include using insecticidal soaps or natural predators to manage their populations.  Remove infected plants: If you notice any plants showing symptoms of TMV, such as mosaic-like patterns on leaves or stunted growth, remove them immediately to prevent the spread of the virus to healthy plants.  Minimize contact: Avoid touching healthy plants after handling infected ones. If possible, work with healthy plants first and then move to infected plants to minimize transmission.  Crop rotation: Practice crop rotation by avoiding planting tomatoes or other susceptible Solanaceae family plants in the same area year after year. This helps break the virus's life cycle and reduces the risk of infection.  Resistant varieties: Consider planting tomato varieties that are resistant to TMV. These varieties have genetic traits that make them less susceptible to the virus and can help reduce the impact of the disease."
